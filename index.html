             <p><b>Hi, I'm India Walker!</b> I'm a Software Engineering student from Detroit, MI. I've been coding since 2017, and have endeavored to learn as much as possible. With both parents having a strong background in Engineering, it was no surprise that my interest in technology took off as quickly as it did.

          <div class="group">
          <div class="item">
            <p>Though my specialty lies in app development--iOS, Android--my skillset is rather large. I'd like to work on dynamic projects with a well-rounded, close-knit team of creative developers. In a professional setting, it is most important for me to have a role that both hones my existing skillset and adds to it. As a budding developer, I'm very open to working on all sorts of projects. Please, feel free to reach out!</p>
        </div>
          <div class="item">
          
          <p> Outside of school and work, I like to cook, play video games, and go on adventures with my dog--Zeus. My top three favorite video games are: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Sims</li>
              <li>Fallout 3</li>
              <li>Gears of War 4</li>
            </ul>
          
            <p>I love to travel as well; someday I'd like to swim in all of the oceans as well as visit all 50 states (maybe the territories too). Internationally, I've visited Scotland, England, Canada, and Mexico. Next on my list is Italy, then Japan. I plan on coding from all over the world!</p>
